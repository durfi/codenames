# How to cheat and avoid cheaters in Codenames
This little project demonstrates how easy it is to cheat in Codenames (the board game).
See it live: https://durfi.github.io/codenames/

Due to the small number of predefined secret maps, it is pretty easy to guess the the
current map after a few rounds of the game.

Click on the cells to input the current state of the game and check below for the
number of possible maps. If there is a single solution left, it appears below the
input.

To defend against cheaters using this method, you should draw a random map for every
round of the game.
